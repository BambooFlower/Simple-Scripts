# snow
Generate snow fall animation.

## Python
Python animation uses pygame, and "simulates" the snow fall by moving each particles through the vector field. Code can be run with 

```
python main.py
```

## C++ OpenGL (GLUT)
A very basic C++ executable to generate the same snow fall animation. To compile and run the program simply run `make` from the working directory. I included an executable compiled on Ubuntu, I am not sure whether it will run  on any other system.
